This was a quiz game with a series of random question that you must answer within a given amount of time or the quiz ends and you fail.  All ten questions show at once and you can answer them in any order but cannot go back and change the answer once you answered a question.  There is a Wrong and Correct section that shows the results of the questions, there is also an alert when you get the question right and wrong.  When the question is wrong it tells you the correct answer.  There is almost no HTML as I dynamically built the HTML with JavaScript.  I wish I would have made the UI a little better and the design overall to make it look a little better.  For example when you answer all the questions correctly or finish the quiz it does not end or tell you that you won or answered them all correctly, you have to wait for the timer to go down and the game to restart or you can manually restart it. 


Can you pass this quiz?:
