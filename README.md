This was a quiz game with a series of random question that you must answer within a given amount of time or the quiz ends and you fail.  All ten questions show at once and you can answer them in any order but cannot go back and change the answer once you answered a question.  There is a Wrong and Correct section that shows the results of the questions, there is also an alert when you get the question right and wrong.  When the question is wrong it tells you the correct answer.  There is almost no HTML as I dynamically built the HTML with JavaScript.  I wish I would have made the UI a little better and the design overall to make it look better. 


Can you pass this quiz?:
